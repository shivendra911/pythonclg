# how to limit acces to new attributes which is not defined in the class.
# eg. creating a new attribute price which is not defined in the class Car. how to restrict that? 
# we can restrict by using __slots__ in the class definition. 
# __slots__ is a special attribute that can be defined in a class to restrict the creation of new attributes that are not defined in the class.

# various types of __slots__ are: 
# __slots__ = []  # restricts all new attributes
# __slots__ = ['price']  # allows only price attribute  
# __slots__ = ['price', 'model']  # allows only price and model attributes



## why to use __init__ in classes?
# __init__ is a special method in Python classes that is called when an object is created. 
# It is used to initialize the attributes of the object with specific values. This allows for more flexible
# and reusable code, as you can create multiple instances of the class with different attribute values without having to write separate code for each instance.



#Why self is needed in classes?
# self is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class within the class definition. 
# It allows you to differentiate between instance attributes and local variables within the class methods. 
# By convention, self is used as the first parameter in instance methods to refer to the instance of the class that is calling the method.


## app = Flask(__name__)  # __name__ is a special variable in Python that represents the name of the current module.
