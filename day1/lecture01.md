SAST Vs DAST
🔐 SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
📌 What it is

SAST analyzes source code without running the application.

🧠 Think of it as

👉 Checking grammar while writing an essay

⚙️ How it works

Scans source code / bytecode

Finds vulnerabilities in logic and implementation

Works early in development

✅ Pros

Finds bugs early

No need to run the app

Pinpoints exact line of code

Good for developers

❌ Cons

False positives

Cannot find runtime issues

Needs access to source code

🛠 Examples

SonarQube

Checkmarx

Fortify

🌐 DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
📌 What it is

DAST tests a running application from the outside.

🧠 Think of it as

👉 Breaking into a house to check security

⚙️ How it works

Runs against live application

Simulates hacker attacks

No access to source code needed

✅ Pros

Finds runtime vulnerabilities

Real-world attack simulation

Fewer false positives

Language-independent

❌ Cons

Can’t point exact code line

Needs deployed app

Finds issues late

🛠 Examples

OWASP ZAP

Burp Suite

Acunetix

⚔️ SAST vs DAST (Quick Comparison)
Feature	SAST	DAST
Testing stage	Development	After deployment
Code required	Yes	No
App running?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Finds runtime bugs	❌ No	✅ Yes
Exact code location	✅ Yes	❌ No
False positives	More	Fewer
🧩 Best Practice (Important)

👉 Use BOTH together

SAST → early bug detection

DAST → real-world security testing

Together they give maximum security coverage.

📝 One-line exam answers

SAST: Security testing by analyzing source code without executing the program.

DAST: Security testing by analyzing a running application from an attacker’s perspective.
