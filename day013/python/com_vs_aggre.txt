| Object creation | External        | Internal    |
| Life cycle      | Independent     | Dependent   |
| Example         | Student–Address | Car–Engine  |


Aggregation → uses
Composition → owns



Abstraction → WHAT to do

Abstraction → HOW YOU DESIGN
Aggregation → HOW OBJECTS CONNECT
Composition → HOW OBJECTS DEPEND


Abstraction ≠ Relationship
Aggregation = Relationship
Composition = Relationship
